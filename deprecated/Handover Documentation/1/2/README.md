# Handover Documentation (Version 1.2) 

This is a Submodel template specification for the Asset Adminstration Shell.

## Scope of the Submodel 

The Submodel Handover Specification defines a standardized exchange format for information or documentation for a specific asset. The scope of this Submodel is to increase the interoperability between the parties that are exchanging asset documentation. These parties can be manufacturers of components or complete machines, or operators using these components or machines. In case a machine manufacturer sells a machine to a customer (operator), the manufacturer hands over the machine and its documentation in form of an AAS with the Submodel “Handover Documentation”. The documents provided can contain information required for e.g. correct design, installation, commissioning, spare parts stocking, operation, cleaning, inspection, maintenance, and repair. In addition, there are legal regulations that stipulate the existence of certain manufacturer documents, such as Communauté Européenne (CE) declarations of conformity, Atmosphères Explosives (ATEX) certificates, or material certificates.
Besides the structure of a Submodel and the exchange format of an AAS, this Submodel standardizes the meta data that comes with the asset documentation and the classes that classify the type of the document. With these standardized meta data and classes, the asset documentation can be automatically integrated in the customer’s document management system, backend system, or any other system.
The meta data as well as the classification classes of this Submodel are based on the VDI Guideline VDI 2770 Blatt 1 “Operation of process engineering plants – Minimum requirements for digital manufacturer information for the process industry” [7]. While the classification of documents according to VDI 2770 is mandatory, additional classification classes can be added.
