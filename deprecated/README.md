# Deprecated Submodel Templates

This folder contains IDTA submodel templates that have been deprecated and are no longer actively maintained in terms of bug fixes and updates. We recommend using the latest version of the respective submodel templates.

## Purpose

The deprecated folder serves as an archive for older versions of submodel templates that have been superseded by newer versions or have become obsolete. These templates are preserved for archival and backward compatibility purposes.

## Deprecation Process

According to the IDTA process, deprecation of a submodel follows these guidelines:

a) An assessment can lead to a submodel being marked as deprecated. This means that its use for new realizations is discouraged. Software tools should, however, continue to be able to work with deprecated models (backward compatibility). Unanimity is required for the Working Group "Submodels" to decide to mark a published submodel as obsolete.

b) Deprecation of submodels will be flagged in GitHub. Additionally, the status of submodels will be reflected on the IDTA website.

c) Deletion of a submodel is not intended.
