## Scope of the Submodel 

This Submodel template aims at interoperable provision of information describing the nameplate of the asset of the respective Asset Administration Shell. Central element is the provision of properties, ideally interoperable by the means of dictionaries such as ECLASS and IEC CDD (Common Data Dictionary). The purpose of this document is to make selected specifications of submodels in such manner that information about assets and their nameplate can be exchanged in a meaningful way between partners in a value creation network. It targets equipment for process industry  and factory automation by defining standardized meta data.  
The intended use-case is the provision of a standardized property structure within a digital nameplate, which enables the interoperability of digital nameplates from different manufacturers. 
This concept can serve as a basis for standardizing the respective submodel. The conception is based on existing norms, directives and standards so that a far-reaching acceptance can be achieved.  
Beside standardized submodel this template also introduces standardized SubmodelElementCollections (SMC) in order to improve the interoperability while modelling partial aspects within submodels. The standardized SMCs include address and asset product marking.
