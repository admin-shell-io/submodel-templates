## Scope of the Submodel 

This Submodel template aims at interoperable provision of technical data describing the asset of the respective Asset 
Administration Shell. Central element is the provision of properties [7], ideally interoperable by the means of 
dictionaries such as ECLASS and IEC CDD (Common data dictionary). 
The intended use-case is, th
at a manufacturer of industrial equipment describes assets (type or instance), which are 
provided to the market, by the means of technical data (properties), which are interoperable and unambiguously 
understood by the other market participants, such as system integrators or operators of industrial equipment. For 
providing individual industrial equipments to the market, also a supplier is covered by the use-case (for this purpose 
seen as functioning as manufacturer). 

This Submodel template specifies a basic set of SubmodelElements in order to bring about the necessary information 
according to this use-case.
