# Technical Data for Automated Guided Vehicles (Version 1.0) 

This is a Submodel template specification for the Asset Adminstration Shell.

## Scope of the Submodel 
The material flow in the factory will increasingly be driverless and autonomously controlled. With the growing penetration of production with AGVs, these will also take on very specific transport, handling and, with the right setup, possibly also assembly or manufacturing tasks. 
In this specification AGV is used as generic term for all driverless vehicles and robots in intralogistics. This Submodel supports all kinds of driverless vehicles like AMR or guided FTF.
Suppliers of AGVs will continue to develop specific capabilities and features for their vehicles and possible attachments. This will inevitably lead to the situation where different types of vehicles and vehicles from different manufacturers have to be operated in one production environment. These mixed fleets have to be integrated in the overall driverless transportation system and controlled via a central or decentral control system. In most cases this control system will be linked to the ERP or MES system where it is receiving the transportation orders from. Control systems can be proprietary systems of the vehicle supplier or manufacturer-independent systems. With increasingly mixed fleets in operation manufacturer-independent control systems will be more widespread on the market.
Against this background, a digital twin in the form of an AAS for the vehicles is to form the data basis for the integration of the individual vehicles into an overall system. The Submodel "Technical Data for Automated Guided Vehicles in Intralogistics" aims to identify the necessary information for integration and standardize it with an AAS Submodel specification. In addition to the integration aspect in an overall system during the engineering phase, the Submodel should also take into account technical data needs for commissioning, operation and maintenance.
