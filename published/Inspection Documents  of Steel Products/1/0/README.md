This Submodel template aims to standardize the representation and storage of inspection data for steel 
products within the steel manufacturing and supply industry, specifically adhering to the DIN EN 10204:2004

The Submodel will manage comprehensive inspection documents, including detailed information about the 
manufacturer and customer, order data, product specifications, mechanical test results, chemical analysis, 
and validation information. By providing a uniform structure for data related to steel product inspections, this 
Submodel enhances traceability, data interoperability, and compliance across the supply chain, ensuring 
added value and efficiency for both suppliers and customers.
