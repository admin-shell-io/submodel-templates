# Artificial Intelligence Model Nameplate (Version 1.0) 

This is a Submodel template specification for the Asset Adminstration Shell.

## Scope of the Submodel 
This Submodel template aims at interoperable provision of information describing Artificial Intelligence (AI) 
model information in regard to the asset of the respective Asset Administration Shell. Central element is the 
provision of properties [7], ideally interoperable by the means of dictionaries such as ECLASS and IEC CDD 
(Common Data Dictionary). The purpose of this document is to make selected specifications of Submodels in 
such manner that information about assets can be exchanged in a meaningful way between partners in a 
value creation network. It targets to assist the AI model documentation and helps to manage an AI lifecycle. 
The intended use-case is the provision of a standardized property structure for documenting AI models, 
which enables an efficient management of the different models and helps to reuse already trained models. 
On top of that it contains information about the responsible person for the model and helps to gain additional 
information of the model from him. 
This concept can serve as a basis for standardizing the respective Submodel. The conception is based on 
existing norms, studies of common practices at enterprises, directives and standards so that a far-reaching 
acceptance can be achieved.
