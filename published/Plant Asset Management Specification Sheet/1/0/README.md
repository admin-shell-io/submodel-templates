# Plant Asset Management Specification Sheet (Version 1.0) 

This is a Submodel template specification for the Asset Adminstration Shell.

## Scope of the Submodel 

The AAS Submodel "Plant Asset Management Specification Sheet" is a crucial tool for the procurement and 
documentation of Plant Asset Management (PAM) functions in industrial settings. Its scope includes 
establishing a clear contractual basis and documenting PAM functions. These functions can range from special 
control system functions to add-on parts on production equipment or enabled functions within the equipment.
The Submodel ensures a well-defined contractual basis during procurement, minimizing misunderstandings 
and improving efficiency. It standardizes requirements, specifications, and expectations related to PAM 
functions, allowing all stakeholders, such as producers, control system manufacturers, and equipment 
manufacturers, to have a shared understanding.
Furthermore, the Submodel serves as documentation for PAM functions, capturing vital information. It includes 
detailed descriptions of function blocks, sensors, and monitoring devices, ensuring a comprehensive record of 
PAM functionalities. This documentation facilitates troubleshooting, maintenance, and modifications.
In addition, the Submodel supports the engineering process, which often involves multiple stakeholders and 
departments. It acts as a central reference, aligning efforts and fostering collaboration between departments 
such as procurement, operation, maintenance, sales, and engineering. The Submodel promotes transparency 
and manages dependencies in engineering PAM functions.
The Submodel also aids decision-making throughout the PAM functions' lifecycle. It provides information for 
informed decisions regarding maintenance, upgrades, and component replacement. It also assists in 
evaluating compatibility and integration of new PAM functions into existing systems. This is crucial for 
managing complex industrial environments with interconnected systems.
The management of online and historical data for a specific PAM function is not within the scope of this 
Submodel. This is because such data may contain highly detailed and specific information that is beyond the 
level of specification covered here. Additionally, the management of this data may be better suited for a 
separate AAS Submodel focused on general condition monitoring, which is not addressed in this particular 
Submodel. The primary focus of this Submodel is to establish a contractual basis, document PAM functions, 
and support the engineering process, rather than delving into the intricacies of online and historical data 
management.
