# Process Parameters Instance (Version 1.0) 

This is a Submodel template specification for the Asset Adminstration Shell.

## Scope of the Submodel 
This Submodel defines instance-specific information of Process Parameters and provides a framework to 
describe the output parameters for processes of industrial equipment. This Submodel does not require any 
knowledge about how a process is executed and in which order. It is solely focused on the structured 
description of data reported by a process.

The need for a dedicated Process Parameters Submodel is to enable the interoperable description and
transfer of data between assets. The concept is based on process knowledge from various organizations in 
the automotive wire harness industry. Although the associated use cases are from the value chain of wire 
harness manufacturing, the aim of the working group is to develop a generalized Submodel that can be used 
for a wide variety of products and industries.

This Submodel is intended for the description of output parameters of a process and should be used in 
combination with the Hierarchical Structures Submodel to define the sequence of process execution and 
hierarchical requirements.
