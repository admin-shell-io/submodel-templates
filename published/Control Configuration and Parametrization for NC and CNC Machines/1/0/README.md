# Control Configuration and Parametrization for NC/CNC Machines (Version 1.0)

This is a Submodel template specification for the Asset Adminstration Shell.

## Scope of the Submodel 

This Submodel template aims at interoperable provision of information describing the “Control configuration 
and parametrization for NC/CNC machines” in regard to the asset of the respective AAS. The purpose of this 
document is to make selected specifications of Submodels in such manner that information about assets can 
be exchanged in a meaningful way between partners in a value creation network. It targets people who are 
commissioning or integrate Computerized Numerical Control (CNC) machines. Therefore, they need data to 
parametrize the CNC control.
The intended use-case is the provision of a standardized property structure for Control configuration and 
parametrization for NC/CNC machines, which enables an easy access of data, which is needed to configure 
or parametrize a CNC controller.
This concept can serve as a basis for standardizing the respective Submodel. The conception is based on 
existing norms, studies of common practices at enterprises, directives and standards so that a far-reaching 
acceptance can be achieved.
Beside standardized Submodel this template also introduces standardized SubmodelElementCollections 
(SMC) in order to improve the interoperability while modelling aspects of Control configuration and 
parametrization for NC/CNC machines within other Submodels.
