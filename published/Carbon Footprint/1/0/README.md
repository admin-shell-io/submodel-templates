# Carbon Footprint (Version 1.0) 

This is a Submodel template specification for the Asset Adminstration Shell.

## Scope of the Submodel 

This Submodel template provides the means to exchange an asset`s Carbon Footprint (CF) between the partners along a value chain. The aim of this Submodel is to increase the interoperability between the parties, who are interested in documenting, exchanging, evaluating, or optimizing the environmental footprint of their assets. These parties can for example be manufacturers, users/consumers, or logistic partners. The CF might be part of larger initiatives, such as the Digital Product Passport (DPP) or the Product Environmental Footprint. It is not the scope of this Submodel template to substitute the relevant certificates. Use cases with increasing complexity are described in the following section. Version 1.0 of this document will focus on Use Cases 1,2, and 3. Additional use cases will be supported in future versions.

## About this version
