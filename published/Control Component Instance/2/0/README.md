# Control Component Instance (Version 2.0) 

This is a Submodel template specification for the Asset Adminstration Shell.

## Scope of the Submodel 
The scope of this Submodel is the definition of instance-specific information of a Control Component 
(CC) into an AAS. Together with its counterpart, the CCType Submodel (IDTA 02015), both 
Submodels aim to establish templates to ensure a uniform structure. The use of these templates 
allows the development of manufacturer- and domain-independent control concepts and facilitates the 
exchange of process information with other Submodels. Additionally, it allows the use of standardized 
call and monitoring sequences, as well as standardized description of its services, endpoints, error codes, etc.
