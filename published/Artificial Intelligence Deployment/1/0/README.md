# Artificial Intelligence Deployment (Version 1.0) 

This is a Submodel template specification for the Asset Adminstration Shell.

## Scope of the Submodel 
This Submodel template aims at interoperable provision of information describing deployment of Artificial 
Intelligence (AI) models in regard to the asset of the respective Asset Administration Shell. Central element 
is the provision of properties [7], ideally interoperable by the means of dictionaries such as ECLASS and IEC 
CDD (Common Data Dictionary). The purpose of this document is to make selected specifications of 
Submodels in such manner that information about assets can be exchanged in a meaningful way between 
partners in a value creation network. It targets the assistance of deployment of AI models in a standardized 
way. Currently the focus is on an industrial environment. 
The intended use-case is the provision of a standardized property structure for deploying AI, which enables 
an easier usage of AI in an industrial environment. With the assistance of two other AI Submodels (AI 
Dataset and AI ModelNameplate), it provides an overview of the whole AI lifecycle and allows an easier 
management of it. 
This concept can serve as a basis for standardizing the respective Submodel. The conception is based on 
existing norms, studies of common practices at enterprises, directives and standards so that a far-reaching 
acceptance can be achieved.
