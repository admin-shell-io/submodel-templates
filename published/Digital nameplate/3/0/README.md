## Scope of the Submodel 

This Submodel template aims to provide asset nameplate information to the respective Asset Administration
Shells in an interoperable manner. Central element is the provision of properties [7], ideally interoperable by
the means of dictionaries such as ECLASS and IEC CDD (Common Data Dictionary). The purpose of this
document is to make selected specifications of Submodels in such manner that information about assets and
their nameplate can be exchanged in a meaningful way between partners in a value creation network. It
targets equipment for process industry and factory automation by defining standardized meta data.
The intended use case is the provision of a standardized property structure within a digital nameplate, which
enables the interoperability of digital nameplates from different manufacturers.
This concept can serve as a basis for standardizing the respective Submodel. The conception is based on
existing norms, directives and standards so that a far-reaching acceptance can be achieved.
Beside standardized Submodel this template also introduces standardized SubmodelElementCollections
(SMC) in order to improve the interoperability while modelling partial aspects within Submodels. The
standardized SMCs include address and asset product marking.
In addition to the general information for Industrial Equipment listed in this document, it may be necessary to
supplement the digital nameplate with additional information for specific areas of application, e.g. for
explosion safety or radio. Information for the digital nameplate for additional areas of application are defined
in supplementary submodel templates
