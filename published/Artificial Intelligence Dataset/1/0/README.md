# Artificial Intelligence Dataset (Version 1.0) 

This is a Submodel template specification for the Asset Adminstration Shell.

## Scope of the Submodel 
This Submodel template aims at interoperable provision of information describing a dataset and meta 
information about it in regard to the asset of the respective Asset Administration Shell. Central element is the 
provision of properties [7], ideally interoperable by the means of dictionaries such as ECLASS and IEC CDD 
(Common Data Dictionary). The purpose of this document is to make selected specifications of Submodels in 
such manner that information about assets can be exchanged in a meaningful way between partners in a 
value creation network. It aims to provide detailed information about a dataset used in AI context. This 
includes additional service information (the person responsible for the dataset).
The intended use-case is the provision of a standardized property structure for datasets used to train AI, 
which enables a standardized way to describe datasets.
This concept can serve as a basis for standardizing the respective Submodel. The conception is based on 
existing norms, studies of common practices at enterprises, directives and standards so that a far-reaching 
acceptance can be achieved.
