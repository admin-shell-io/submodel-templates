## Scope of the Submodel 

This Submodel template aims at interoperable provision of technical data describing the asset of the
respective Asset Administration Shell. Central element is the provision of properties [7], ideally interoperable
by the means of dictionaries such as ECLASS and IEC CDD (Common data dictionary).
The intended use-case is, that a manufacturer of industrial products to equipment describes technical data of
assets (type or instance), which are provided to the market. This description is achieved by the means of
technical data (properties), which are interoperable and unambiguously understood by the other market
participants, such as system integrators or operators of industrial products to equipment. These properties
are selected for human comprehension and are not necessarily representing a full class definition within a
classification system. For providing individual industrial products to equipments to the market, also a supplier
is covered by the use-case (for this purpose seen as functioning as manufacturer).

This Submodel template specifies a basic set of SubmodelElements to provide the necessary information for
this use case.
