# Hierarchical Structures enabling Bills of Material-Extension based on IEC 81346 (Version 1.0)

This is a Submodel template specification for the Asset Adminstration Shell.

## Scope of the Submodel 

The structuring of machines, plants or systems is an essential task in engineering to make the complexity of a technical system manageable. IEC 81346 standardises a concept of structuring based on various aspects that an object (asset) can have. In this sense, a system always consists of several objects, which means that the system (composite asset) also has corresponding aspects. Figure 1 shows three of the aspects as examples. The standard describes a total of five aspects:
•	What an object is supposed to do or what it actually does – Function aspect (=)
•	The means by which an object does what it is supposed to do – Product aspect (-)
•	Planned or actual location of the object – Location aspect (+)
•	Group of objects that have the same properties – Type aspect (%)
•	A freely definable aspect that must be specified by the creator – Other aspect (#)

Hierarchies are created by structuring the various aspects, which is why the Hierarchical Structures enabling Bills of Material Submodel is extended in accordance with the IEC standard. Each aspect can in turn have its own hierarchy. 
This Submodel is based on IEC 81346 Part 1 2021, further details can be found in the IEC; this version is also based on the Hierarchical Structures enabling Bills of Material Submodel in version 1.1.
