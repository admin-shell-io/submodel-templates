== General

=== About this document

This document is a part of a specification series.
Each part specifies the contents of a Submodel template for the Asset Administration Shell (AAS).
The AAS is described in xref:#bib1[+[1]+] xref:#bib2[+[2]+], xref:#bib3[+[3]+] and xref:#bib6[+[6]+].
First exemplary Submodel contents were described in xref:#bib4[+[4]+], while the actual format of this document was derived by the "Administration Shell in Practice" xref:#bib5[+[5]+].
The format aims to be very concise, giving only minimal necessary information for applying a Submodel template, while leaving deeper descriptions and specification of concepts, structures and mapping to the respective documents xref:#bib1[+[1]+] to xref:#bib6[+[6]+].

The target group of the specification are developers and editors of technical documentation and manufacturer information, which are describing assets in smart manufacturing by means of the Asset Administration Shell (AAS) and therefore need to create a Submodel instance with a hierarchy of SubmodelElements.
This document especially details on the question, which Submodel Elements with which semantic identification shall be used for this purpose.

=== Scope of the Submodels

Engineering tools used for the design of safety control system of machinery and similar control systems need functional safety and reliability data.

The purpose of this Submodel is to define the structure and relevant reliability properties for devices suitable for customer demands.

The intended benefits of this Submodel are to:

* reduce the costs, time and efforts of mapping data for each customer request;

* optimize the workflow of information exchange with engineering tools;

* facilitate the selection of a product, especially regarding reliability;

* give access to product data everywhere regardless of country, language and culture;

=== Relevant standards for the Submodel template

IEC 60947-1:2020, Low-voltage switchgear and controlgear - Part 1: General rules

IEC 61360-1:2017, Standard data element types with associated classification scheme – Part 1: Definitions – Principles and methods

IEC 62683-1 DB, Low-voltage switchgear and controlgear - Product data and properties for information exchange - Part 1: Catalogue data

IEC 61987 DB, Industrial-process measurement and control - Data structures and elements in process equipment catalogues

IEC 62061:2021, Safety of machinery - Functional safety of safety-related control systems

ISO 13849-1:2015, Safety of machinery – Safety-related parts of control systems – Part 1: General principles for design

VDMA 66413:2012, Functional Safety - Universal data format for safety-related values of components or parts of control system

=== Use cases, requirements, and design decisions

Application of the relevant standards (1.3) requires the exchange of relevant data between all concerned: machine manufacturers, device manufacturers and calculation tools.

*Device manufacturers* create characteristic value libraries for their devices in "universal data format".
The device manufacturer is the person who manufactures devices and/or components and makes them available to the machine manufacturer or user in the spirit of the free movement of goods.
As a result, the creator of a characteristic value library can and indeed may only be the device manufacturer.

*Calculation tool (suppliers)* provide a mechanism for importing characteristic value libraries in database format.
The characteristic values are prepared for display and selection within the tool.

*Machine manufacturers* use the characteristic values library (file) provided by the device manufacturer to read and update the characteristic values (device data) within the calculation tool.

== Explanations on used table formats

=== General

The used tables in this document try to outline information as concise as possible.
They do not convey all information on Submodels and SubmodelElements.
For this purpose, the definitive definitions are given by a separate file in form of an AASX file of the Submodel template and its elements.

=== Tables on Submodels and SubmodelElements

For clarity and brevity, a set of rules is used for the tables for describing Submodels and SubmodelElements.

* The tables follow in principle the same conventions as in xref:#bib5[+[5]+].

* The table heads abbreviate 'cardinality' with 'card'.

* The tables often place two information in different rows of the same table cell.
In this case, the first information is marked out by sharp brackets +[]+ form the second information.
A special case are the semanticIds, which are marked out by the format: (type)(local)+[idType]+ value.

* The types of SubmodelElements are abbreviated:

[width="100%",cols="41%,59%",options="header",]
|===
h| SME type
h| SubmodelElement type
|Property |Property
|MLP |MultiLanguageProperty
|Range |Range
|File |File
|Blob |Blob
|Ref |ReferenceElement
|Rel |RelationshipElement
|SMC |SubmodelElementCollection
|===

* If an idShort ends with '\{00}', this indicates a suffix of the respective length (here: 2) of decimal digits, in order to make the idShort unique.
A different idShort might be chosen, as long as it is unique in the parent's context.

* The Keys of semanticId in the main section feature only idType and value, such as: +[IRI]+ https://admin-shell.io/vdi/2770/1/0/DocumentId/Id.
The attributes "type" and "local" (typically "ConceptDescription" and "(local)" or "GlobalReference" and (non-local)") need to be set accordingly; see xref:#bib6[+[6]+].

* If a table does not contain a column with "parent" heading, all represented attributes share the same parent.
This parent is denoted in the head of the table.
* Multi-language strings are represented by the text value, followed by '@'-character and the ISO 639 language code: example@EN.

* The +[valueType]+ is only given for Properties.
