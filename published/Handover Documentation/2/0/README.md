## Scope of the Submodel 

The Submodel Handover Documentation defines a standardized exchange format for information or
documentation for a specific asset. This can be both type and instance information. The scope of this
Submodel is to increase the interoperability between the parties that are exchanging asset documentation.
These parties can be manufacturers of components or complete machines, or operators using these
components or machines. In case a machine manufacturer sells a machine to a customer (operator), the
manufacturer hands over the machine and its documentation in form of an AAS with the Submodel
“Handover Documentation”. The documents provided can contain information required for e.g. correct
design, installation, commissioning, spare parts stocking, operation, cleaning, inspection, maintenance, and
repair. In addition, there are legal regulations that stipulate the existence of certain manufacturer documents,
such as Communauté Européenne (CE) declarations of conformity, Atmosphères Explosives (ATEX)
certificates, or material certificates.

Besides the structure of a Submodel and the exchange format of an AAS, this Submodel standardizes the
meta data that comes with the asset documentation and the classes that classify the type of the document.
With these standardized meta data and classes, the asset documentation can be automatically integrated in
the customer’s document management system, backend system, or any other system.

The meta data as well as the classification classes of this Submodel are based on the VDI Guideline VDI
2770 Blatt 1 “Operation of process engineering plants – Minimum requirements for digital manufacturer
information for the process industry”. While the classification of documents according to VDI 2770 is
mandatory, additional classification classes can be added.
