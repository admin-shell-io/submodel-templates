# Energy Flexibility Data Model (Version 1.0)

This is a Submodel template specification for the Asset Administration Shell.

## Scope of the Submodel

Energy flexibility is the ability of a system, particularly in industrial settings, to adjust its electricity consumption in response to external signals, such as price fluctuations or grid stability requirements. This adaptability allows production systems to align their energy usage with market conditions, contributing to both grid stability and operational efficiency.

In this context, the Submodel Energy Flexibility Data Model (EFDM) serves as a standardized information model in the form of AAS. EFDM is designed to enable automated and streamlined communication between various entities, including production systems, energy market participants, and service providers. By providing a unified framework for describing energy flexibility, the EFDM facilitates efficient data exchange, reduces the need for customized integrations, and minimizes translation errors. This standardization ultimately supports a more resilient, flexible, and economically optimized energy system.

Energy flexibility is modeled within EFDM in terms of flexibility potential and specific flexibility measures. However, instead of constructing a complete digital twin, the EFDM prioritizes key properties necessary to describe energy flexibility effectively, minimizing data complexity and protecting sensitive operational data.
