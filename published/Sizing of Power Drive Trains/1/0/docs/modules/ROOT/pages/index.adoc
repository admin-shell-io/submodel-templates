== General

=== About this document
This document is a part of a specification series. Each part specifies the contents of a Submodel template for
the Asset Administration Shell (AAS). The AAS is described in [1], [2], [3] and [6]. First exemplary Submodel
contents were described in [4], while the actual format of this document was derived by the "Administration
Shell in Practice" [5]. The format aims to be very concise, giving only minimal necessary information for
applying a Submodel template, while leaving deeper descriptions and specification of concepts, structures
and mapping to the respective documents [1] to [6].

The target group of the specification are developers and editors of technical documentation and
manufacturer information, which are describing assets in smart manufacturing by means of the Asset
Administration Shell (AAS) and therefore need to create a Submodel instance with a hierarchy of
SubmodelElements. This document especially details on the question, which SubmodelElements with which
semantic identification shall be used for this purpose.


=== Scope of the Submodel
The Submodel template aims at interoperable provision of information, especially information for sizing
electrical drive systems in industrial automation. For this purpose, the essential components drive, motor,
gearbox, transformation as well as their additional components are described and the parameters necessary
for the calculation are considered. Mechanical and electrical aspects are considered in the drive design. The
Submodel specification addresses machine and plant manufacturers, manufacturers of drive compontents
and developers of sizing tools that exchange information for the use case of drive design. The objective of
the drive design is to select suitable components based on movement patterns and system requirements.

==== AutomationML integration
The data exchange format AutomationML which is standardising in the IEC 62714 standard is a neutral, free,and XML-based data format. It has been developed in order to support the data exchange betweenengineering tools in a heterogeneous engineering tool landscape. As AutomationML is the leading format fordata exchange in the engineering phase and AAS to be seen as the medium to transport data acrossdifferent phases of the lifecycle, the existing AutomationML model shall be used and integrated into the AAS.With this only data required in other phases than engineering shall be “published” in the AAS. All other datashall remain in the AutomationML file. There are options to integrate the AutomationML model in the AAS,which are not yet published. These options will be part of specification in further versions.

=== Use cases, requirements and design decisions
The Submodel template specification addresses machine and plant manufacturers, manufacturers of drive
compontents and developer of sizing tools that exchange information for the use case of drive design. The
objective of the drive design is to select suitable components based on movement patterns and system
requirements. The Submodel itself can be assigned to a design project, a drive axis or even individual
components of a drive system. The Leading Picture (Figure 1) defines the scope within which the use cases
of the Submodel can be classified.

Figure 2 and Table 1 shows the target picture of how, with the help of digital twins, the information, e.g. in the
development of a machine, is created step by step in the value network around the drive sizing and which
other AAS Submodels should play a role.

== Sizing of Power Drive Trains

=== Approach
The Submodel template specification was created by the ZVEI e. V. working group "Industrie 4.0 Drive
Technology", AutomationML e.V and the Industrial Digital Twin Association e.V. For this Submodel template
specification, the sizing tools of different providers and their data formats were compared. From this, crossvendor characteristics were derived. In addition, the existing Automation ML and AAS Submodels were
examined and evaluated for use in the context of data exchange in the sizing process.

=== Explanations and definitions
The PowerDriveTrainSizing Submodel consists of four structuring sections that are used within the sizing
process. The Submodel itself can be assigned to a sizing project, a drive axis, or even individual components
of a drive system. In future versions of the specification, further sections are planned in which more in-depth
connections and relationships can be modeled.
Major components that are described:

- Sizing Project: Identifying characteristics of the sizing project with reference to the sizing project file.
- Application Requirements:
* Motion and load profile: The specified motion sequence and the calculated motion, taking into account the workload and customer specifications.
* Environmental: Environmental conditions in which the drive train is to be operated.
* System Requirements: The features required by the customer in the selection of individual components and in the consideration of the overall system.
* UsageProfile: Usage profiles to make the TCO life cycle assessment
- Transformation mechanisms: Mechanisms for transmitting the force in the drive task, such as belt or rack and pinion applications.
- SizingResult:
* Bill of Material: Simple list for ordering the individual components.
* Utilization Rates: Technical data of the drive components and their utilization rates in relation to the requirements in the motion profile.
* Messages and Text statements: Interpretative notes and general texts

==== Sizing Project Information
For Use Case 1, the sizing project file is to be integrated including the metadata that must be attached to a
sizing documentation. This includes the project name, contact details and the name of the sizing tool and the
versions used.

The sizing project file with the reference to the sizing tool and the creation and modification timestamps can
also be included in the asset administration shell.

Notice - the sizing project may be in a proprietary data format. Preferred standard for the engineering phase
is the Automation ML File Format.

Notice - Further information, such as the contact details of the persons involved in the design or approval
workflows are feasible.

image::Figure_4.png[id="Figure_4", width="100.0%",title="UML Diagram of SizingProjectInformation"]


==== Application Requirements and Motion patterns
The application requirements section contains the customer's specifications for the drive task. Customer
requirements are divided into the sections motion pattern, environmental conditions, overall system
requirements and operation patterns.

image::Figure_5.png[id="Figure_5", width="100.0%",title="UML Diagram of ApplicationRequirements"]

The basis for selecting the optimal drive system is the motion and load patterns that needs to be met. The
motion pattern consists of individual motion sections that specify the travel distance, the travel time and the
forces. Motion patterns are differentiated by linear and rotative motion.

|===
A motion pattern consists of one or more sections within which motion sequences can be defined and
passed as time series.

To be compatible with existing systems, the motion profile is to be imported as CSV. The comma-separated
column headings and order are based on the characteristics and units specified in the MetadataRecord. Line
1 is therefore skipped during import.

Definitions for the CSV files:

- Line 1 as heading consisting of "idShort + [Unit]", from line 2 the values start
- As separator between the columns ";"
- Float numbers
- Decimal separator "."

The section of the *environmental conditions* contains all requirements for the drive system, which are
based on the operating conditions. In addition to the properties defined in this specification, further properties
can be added by the User.

The *overall system requirements* refer to the characteristics of the drive system, in particular its interfaces
to the power supply, mechanical integration or cooling. In addition to the properties defined in this
specification, further properties can be added by the User.

Notice - The current specification assumes a single axis. for multiple axes, the system requirements, if
different, would also need to be described multiple times.

==== Transformation mechanisms
A transformation mechanism (application) is used, for example, to generate linear output motions through
rotational drive motions. For the optimum sizing of the drive system, data of the application must be
determined. The working group compared some common mechanisms from different sizing tools. More
mechanisms will follow. The descriptive characteristics also represent the common denominator for a basic
interpretation. Vendor specific extensions through additional properties are given. All applications are listed
in the submodel template - note that only one application mechanism can be selected in the sizing project
instance.

image::Figure_6.png[id="Figure_6", width="100.0%",title="UML Diagram of TransformationMechanism"]


==== Sizing Results
The sizing results section contains the result data related to the overall system and the individual
components. In particular, the specification shows the sizing results of the overall system and the relevant
individual components (such as drive, motor, gearbox). Further components, such as add-on parts and
accessories, can be inserted in the "SizingResultOther" section.


image::Figure_7.png[id="Figure_7", width="100.0%",title="UML Diagram of SizingResult"]

Notice - The AutomationML file for the sizing project contains a complete list of relationships. In the AAS
Submodel, only the mechanical attachment is to be represented.

== Annex A.	Explanations on used table formats

=== 1. General

The used tables in this document try to outline information as concise as possible. They do not convey all information on Submodels and SubmodelElements. For this purpose, the definitive definitions are given by a separate file in form of an AASX file of the Submodel template and its elements.

=== 2. Tables on Submodels and SubmodelElements

For clarity and brevity, a set of rules is used for the tables for describing Submodels and SubmodelElements.

* The tables follow in principle the same conventions as in [5].
* The table heads abbreviate 'cardinality' with 'card'.
* The tables often place two informations in different rows of the same table cell. In this case, the first information is marked out by sharp brackets [] form the second information. A special case are the semanticIds, which are marked out by the format: (type)(local)[idType]value.
* The types of SubmodelElements are abbreviated:

[width="100%",cols="40%,60%",options="header"]
|===
|SME type |SubmodelElement type
|Property |Property
|MLP |MultiLanguageProperty
|Range |Range
|File |File
|Blob |Blob
|Ref |ReferenceElement
|Rel |RelationshipElement
|SMC |SubmodelElementCollection
|===

* If an idShort ends with '\__00__', this indicates a suffix of the respective length (here: 2) of decimal digits, in order to make the idShort unique. A different idShort might be choosen, as long as it is unique in the parent’s context.
* The Keys of semanticId in the main section feature only idType and value, such as: https://admin-shell.io/vdi/2770/1/0/DocumentId/Id. The attribute "type" (typically "ConceptDescription" and "(local)" or "GlobalReference") need to be set accordingly; see [6].
* If a table does not contain a column with "parent" heading, all represented attributes share the same parent. This parent is denoted in the head of the table.
* Multi-language strings are represented by the text value, followed by '@'-character and the ISO 639 language code: example@EN.
* The [valueType] is only given for Properties.
