# Intelligent Information for Use (Version 1.0) 

This is a Submodel template specification for the Asset Adminstration Shell.

## Scope of the Submodel 
This Submodel template aims at interoperable provision of information describing the provisioning of “Intelligent Information for Use”, i.e. information of the Technical Documentation enriched by metadata based on the iiRDS (Intelligent Information Retrieval and Delivery Standard, see Table 2) Standard v1.2 with respect of the asset of the respective Asset Administration Shell. Central element is the provisioning of properties [5], ideally interoperable by the means of dictionaries such as ECLASS and IEC CDD (Common Data Dictionary). The purpose of this document is to make selected specifications of Submodels in such manner that information about assets can be exchanged in a meaningful way between partners in a value creation network. 
Target is the cross-manufacturer exchange of technical documentation as information for use. The technical documentation should be transferable as intelligent information, i.e., the content should be modular, semantically rich, and exchangeable in different media formats as well as in media-specific compilations.
Compared to the conventional document-based exchange of technical documentation, the aim is to enable dynamic, structured, and intelligent transmission that can provide content for users in a user-oriented form. This includes usage scenarios in Industry 4.0, websites, mobile apps, portal applications and display on HMIs. The relevant information should be able to be displayed to the user at the right time, in the right context, in the right format, and on the right end device.
The intended use-case is the provisioning of a standardized property structure to exchange and integrate intelligent information between companies, the departments of a company and information from different sources in general. 
This concept can serve as a basis for standardizing the respective Submodel. The conception is based on existing norms, studies of common practices at enterprises, directives and standards so that a far-reaching acceptance can be achieved.
Beside standardized Submodel this template also introduces standardized SubmodelElementCollections (SMC) in order to improve the interoperability while modelling aspects and properties of intelligent information within other Submodels.
