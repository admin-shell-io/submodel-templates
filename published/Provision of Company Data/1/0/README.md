# Provision of Company Data (Version 1.0)

This is a Submodel template specification for the Asset Administration Shell.

## Scope of the Submodel

Companies are required to collect and manage data from their suppliers and, in turn, provide relevant information to their customers when acting as suppliers. This data must be maintained as part of the supplier qualification process.

This Submodel aims to provide an automated and standardized way to exchange the most relevant and most frequently requested data about companies. It is out of scope for the Submodel to provide all information required by detailed assessment processes, such as information highly specific to certain industries.

The Submodel covers the following subject areas:

- **Basic information**: company name, logo, description and industry
- **Identifiers**: Tax identification numbers and other legal or regulatory identifiers
- **Business figures**: Financial data, employee count, other annual key metrics
- **Payment Details**: Bank account information
- **Certificates and Declarations**: Relevant certifications for the company's industry, and documentation on company governance and compliance with laws
- **Risk management**: Policies in place to assure security and business continuity
- **IT systems**: Information on the IT systems and tools in use at the company and options for digital data exchange with external parties

Information which can be provided by other AAS Submodels, such as address data, company structure or production capabilities, is not covered.
